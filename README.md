### A bit about the projects I am working on?
[Lynksy] is a project that I started for the 100 days of code challenge, it is a link in bio tool which I plan to flesh out and rebuild using elements from React along with a few other frameworks. [Tracker of Thieves][tot] is a brainchild I had while playing the video game [Sea of Thieves](https://www.seaofthieves.com/) which allows you to search for locations to receive the co-ordinates on the world map. 

#### Future Projects;
- Rebuild of [Lynksy]
- Wedding website
- Wordpress & Shopify theme(s) 
- E-commerce projects
